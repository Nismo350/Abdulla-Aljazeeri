My idea for the project.

The game that i am plaing to make:

. memory flash card

SODO CODE.

First of all i am going to do the basic html code.

going to link the html/javascript/css.

Secondly with filling the html and the innerText.

thirdly going to set up the header for the web page witch is the title.

going to set up the div's and sections for the cards witch is going to be on the face of the page.

going to write the tags and the button tag for reset button

going to go for the styling phase to set up the hole web page to remove the margin and the padding with * {} mark.

after that going to fix the body or the main depending on what i need to fix and perfect the web page.

doing the sections fixing the margin, background-coloring ex...

going to move for the div's to fix them as cards independingly.

going to move to the javascript, and start coding on it

firstly i will asgin the tags in veraibles in const/let.

after that asign the functions that i am going to be using on my addeventlister

going to check every setp by console.log().

moving to the addEventLister section and try to make it as simble as possible.

going to check the functionalty for the hole game in the website.
